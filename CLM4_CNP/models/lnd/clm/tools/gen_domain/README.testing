There is automated testing for this program in the CLM standalone test scripts
in models/lnd/clm/test/system. There are several assumptions made in order for the 
testing to work.


1.) Build works the same for other CLM Fortran tools

The build for any Fortran tools should work the same way, with the same options
and required files for it. The files: Makefile, and Filepath are expected to exist
in the tool "src" sub-directory. The other CLM tools additionally have the files:
Srcfiles, MkDepends, and Macros.custom. The Makefile and Mkdepends files for the
other CLM tools are intended to be kept identical other than the default settings 
for OPT and SMP and the output executable name. The Makefile for gen_domain MUST
remain similar as well. The options for them MUST be identical as follows.

Options to the Makefile:

 LIB_NETCDF --- Library directory location of NetCDF. (defaults to /usr/local/lib)
 INC_NETCDF --- Include directory location of NetCDF. (defaults to /usr/local/include)
 MOD_NETCDF --- Module directory location of NetCDF.  (defaults to $LIB_NETCDF)
 USER_FC ------ Allow user to override the default Fortran compiler specified in Makefile.
 USER_FCTYP --- Allow user to override the default type of Fortran compiler 
                (Linux and USER_FC=ftn only).
 USER_CC ------ Allow user to override the default C compiler specified in Makefile
                (Linux only).
 USER_LINKER -- Allow user to override the default linker specified in Makefile.
 SMP ---------- Shared memory Multi-processing (TRUE or FALSE) [default is FALSE]
 OPT ---------- Use optimized options. (TRUE or FALSE)

2.) Successful completion of the tool ends with "Successfully created ..."

After the tool completes it should have an unique string telling of the 
successful completion of the file that is searchable in the log file starting
with "Successfully created ". If this string isn't found in the log file, it
will be assumed by the test setup that the test failed.

3.) NetCDF files are created or modified

It is assumed that NetCDF files are created and/or modified by the process. And if
NetCDF files are NOT created -- something went wrong.
